(* csv.ml - comma separated values parser

(* The format of CSV files:
 *
 * Each field starts with either a double quote char or some other
 * char. For the some other char case things are simple: just read up
 * to the next comma (,) which marks the end of the field.
 *
 * In the case where a field begins with a double quote char the
 * parsing rules are different. Any double quotes are doubled ("") and
 * we finish reading when we reach an undoubled quote. eg: "The
 * following is a quote: "", and that's all" is the CSV equivalent of
 * the following literal field: The following is a quote: ", and that's
 * all
 *
 * "0 is the quoted form of ASCII NUL.
 *
 * CSV fields can also contain literal carriage return characters, if
 * they are quoted, eg: "This field
 * is split over lines" represents a
 * single field containing a \n.
 *
 * Excel will only use the quoting format if a field contains a double
 * quote or comma, although there's no reason why Excel couldn't always
 * use the quoted format.
 *
 * The practical upshot of this is that you can't split a line in a CSV
 * file just by looking at the commas. You need to parse each field
 * separately.
 *
 * How we represent CSV files:
 *
 * We load in the whole CSV file at once, and store it internally as a
 * 'string list list' type (note that each line in the CSV file can,
 * and often will, have different lengths). We then provide simple
 * functions to read the CSV file line-by-line, copy it out, or copy a
 * subset of it into a matrix.
